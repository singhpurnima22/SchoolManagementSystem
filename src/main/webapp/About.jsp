		Quotable Quotes : 
		Then only will India awake, when
		hundreds of large hearted men and women, giving up all desires of
		enjoying the luxuries of life, will long and exert themselves to their
		utmost, for the well being of the millions of their countrymen. â€“
		Swami Vivekananda <br><br>
		Motto of Institutions is to develop a
		national system of education which may mould the posterity into such a
		youthful generation as fully saturated with the feeling of Indian
		culture and patriotism, having completely attained all round physical,
		mental, intellectual and spiritual development capable of facing
		modern challenges successfully and dedicating their lives for the
		service and establishment of the poor and deprived, <br><br>the dwellers of
		the slums and natives of remote tribal areas so that these downtrodden
		people may get rid of economic exploitation social humiliation and
		injustice,<br> and usher in a new area of mutual equity, cultural
		integrity and economic prosperity.</h4></p>
